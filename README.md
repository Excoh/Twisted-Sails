<h3> The Game </h3>
<b>Twisted Sails</b> is a "deathmatch" vehicle shooter set on the high seas made with the <b> Unity3D</b> game engine. We like to think of it as the <i>Overwatch </i> of pirate ship games! Take your pick of four unique battle ships from a classic pirate war machine with a forceful front shotgun cannon to a graceful sun trireme with the power of the sun on deck. Surpass your competitors by controlling your crew-- allocate attribute points toward your attack, defense, or speed. Navigate through the ancient ruins of an epic battle between gods to be the first team to twenty kills.
